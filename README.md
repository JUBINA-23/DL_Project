# PCOS Classification with Artificial Neural Networks(ANN)
This project predicts Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using an ANN trained on medical data. It processes patient features like Age, BMI, Menstrual Irregularity, Testosterone Level, and Antral Follicle Count to classify PCOS cases. 

The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras, optimized with Adam and evaluated using accuracy metrics resulting an accuracy above 90%. The model predicts whether there is a chance of PCOS or not, based on sample data input by user. 

Future improvements include feature importance analysis, model comparisons, and web deployment.
